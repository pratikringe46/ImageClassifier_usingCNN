# Image Classification Using CNN

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images into categories (sad and happy).  
It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Scaling and splitting the dataset.
- Model: Custom CNN architecture for image classification.
- Training: Optimized training and validation setup.
- Visualization: Performance evaluation through plots.

## Tech Stack Used

- Python 
- TensorFlow 
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
